# Core Machine Learning & Data Handling:
# tensorflow              For other systems (Linux/Windows, or Intel Macs without dedicated Nvidia GPU) 
tensorflow-macos          # TensorFlow optimized for macOS (includes CPU support)
tensorflow-metal          # Metal PluggableDevice for TensorFlow, enabling M1 GPU acceleration
numpy                     # Fundamental package for numerical computation
pandas                    # For data manipulation and analysis (useful for handling metadata if needed)

# Audio Processing
librosa                   # For audio analysis, MFCC extraction

# Dataset Management
tensorflow-datasets       # For easily downloading and managing datasets like Speech Commands

# Plotting & Visualization
matplotlib                # For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
seaborn                   # For statistical data visualization (e.g., nice confusion matrices)

# Scikit-learn for additional utilities and metrics
scikit-learn              # For train/test splits, metrics (precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix), and potentially simple models for comparison if desired

# Optional: For Jupyter Notebooks
jupyterlab
notebook

# Optional: For linting and formatting
flake8
black

# Optional: For MCU interaction (for deployment or testing)
pyserial                  # For serial communication with MCUs like Arduino/ESP32 (e.g., to send commands or receive data)
sounddevice               # For recording audio directly in Python or playing back test sounds (cross-platform)
